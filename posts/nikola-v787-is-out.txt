On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.8.7. This is a part-emergency bugfix,
part-world domination release.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola`` or download tarballs on `GitHub`__ and `PyPI`__.

Changes
=======

In an effort to improve interoperability with other static site
generators, make importing data easier, and help with world
domination, Nikola v7.8.7 ships with support for the following
metadata formats:

* reST-style comments (``.. name: value`` — default format)
* Two-file format (reST-style comments or 7-line)
* Jupyter Notebook metadata
* YAML, between ``---`` (Jekyll, Hugo)
* TOML, between ``+++`` (Hugo)
* reST docinfo (Pelican)
* Markdown metadata extension (Pelican)

In addition, Markdown is now enabled and required by default.
More details: https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#metadata-formats

The release also fixes two important bugs, one that crashes when
trying to detect locale in some edge cases, and another which made
some themes quietly leak template files.  If you’re using a
Jinja2-based theme that does not have its own ``parent`` file, please
force a rebuild (``nikola build -a``).

* Enable markdown by default (part of Issue #2809)
* Allowing to register filters from plugins, and allowing to specify default
  filters as strings of the form ``filters.<name>`` (part of Issue #2475)

  (Issue #2812)
* Ignore unused Colorbox locales (Issue #2812)
* Accept tag metadata as lists for YAML/TOML (Issue #2801)
* Support for mapping metadata from other formats to Nikola names
  using the ``METADATA_MAPPING`` setting (Issue #2817)
* Support for reStructured text docinfo metadata with
  ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA`` option, defaulting to False (Issue #1923)
* New ``HIDE_REST_DOCINFO`` option, defaulting to False.
* Support for Markdown Metadata for Pelican compatibility by adding
  ``'markdown.extensions.meta'`` to ``MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS`` (Issue #1923)
* Support for YAML and TOML metadata (Issue #2801)

--------

* Use inheritance tree when looking for theme engine (Issue #2816)
