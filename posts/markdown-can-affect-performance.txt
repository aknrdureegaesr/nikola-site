Markdown is a very popular input format for static site generators, that's why
Nikola has supported it since very early in life, even if I prefer reSt most
of the time.

One thing that has surprised me a while ago is that, considering how minimalistic
markdown is, and how little it does, it can be pretty slow to process. But it
turns out this is not completely markdown's fault, but that the python markdown
implementation is really, *really*, **really** slow.

How slow? Let's check it out. All benchmarks in this post were done in my notebook,
a nice Asus Zenbook UX305, with a fast SSD and plenty of RAM. In all cases the builds
were done using no parallelization.

The test site is an empty site to which I added 1000 copies of a simple, not too large
markdown file (our theming guide, converted from reSt using pandoc).

As a baseline, a site with 1000 copies of the original reSt theming.txt builds in ``126`` seconds.

The markdown version of that site? It gets progressively slower as files build, so
I suspect it leaks *something* between builds, and finishes in ... ``1584```seconds. That is
over 12 times **slower** than the reSt compiler.

But you don't want to switch to reSt? No problem! We support more markdown compilers than
we probably should, so you can just choose which one you prefer.

Here is a `chart <https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#chart>`__ showing the performance of each (HTML and reSt added as reference):

   'markdown', [1584]
   'kramdown', [194]
   'rest', [126]
   'pandoc', [110]
   'commonmark', [64]
   'mistune', [34]
   'mistune+cython', [32]
   'misaka', [25]
   'html', [14]

There are just a few disadvantages to using any of the alternative Markdown compilers:

* They are less tested, because fewer people use them (and if you use them, that changes!)
* They may lack a specific feature of the "standard" markdown compiler, such as extension
  support (in which case, `file a bug <https://github.com/getnikola/issues>`__ with us!)
* The produced output may differ from the "standard", but that happens :-)
