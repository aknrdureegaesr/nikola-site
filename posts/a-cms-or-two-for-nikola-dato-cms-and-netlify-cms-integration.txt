.. description: Three CMSes for Nikola: Dato CMS, Netlify CMS, and Contentful.

One of the many complaints users have about static site generators is the fact
that non-tech-savvy users who don’t understand the command line or don’t want
to learn Markdown/reST can’t use SSGs. We’ve tried to solve this before with
Coil CMS, but that project is now dead, and was hard to configure properly.
The problem was not solved, *until now*.

Roberto Alsina and Chris Warrick independently built integrations for **Dato
CMS**, **Netlify CMS** and **Contentful**. Here they are:

* https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/datocms/
* https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-netlify-cms
* https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/contentful/

Both CMSes offer facilities for non-technical editors to write content,
including a **WYSIWYG** editor.

**Dato CMS** may require a bit more work at first, but you can automate it (eg. with
Travis CI, or Netlify). Our integration lets you deploy your site anywhere.

**Netlify CMS** can be deployed with one click (and a few configuration changes),
and includes automation and hosting at Netlify (and GitHub). You can also use
some other hosting service, but that will require some extra work on your side.

**Contentful** does not require a local install of Node to work, which makes
it easier to use and automate, while leaving the hosting up to you.

Make sure to check them both out — have fun!

*(Updated 2017-12-06 to add Contentful support)*
