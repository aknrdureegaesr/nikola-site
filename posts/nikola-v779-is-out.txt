On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.7.9. It fixes some bugs and adds new
features.

For this release, we also passed a milestone — Nikola has got over 1000 stars on GitHub. Thanks for the continued support!

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).
