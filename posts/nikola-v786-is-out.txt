On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.8.6. It fixes some bugs and adds new
features.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola`` or download tarballs on `GitHub`__ and `PyPI`__.

Or if you prefer, Snapcraft packages are now built automatically, and Nikola v7.8.6 will be available in the stable channel.

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Guess file format from file name on new_post (Issue #2798)
* Use BaguetteBox as lightbox in base theme (Issue #2777)
* New ``deduplicate_ids`` filter, for preventing duplication of HTML
  ``id`` attributes (Issue #2570)
* Ported gallery image layout to base theme (Issue #2775)
* Better error handling when posts can't be parsed (Issue #2771)
* Use ``.theme`` files to store theme metadata (Issue #2758)
* New ``add_header_permalinks`` filter, for Sphinx-style header links
  (Issue #2636)
* Added alternate links for gallery translations (Issue #993)

Bugfixes
--------

* Use ``locale.getdefaultlocale()`` for better locale guessing
  (credit: @madduck)
* Save dependencies for template hooks properly (using ``.__doc__`` or
  ``.template_registry_identifier`` for callables)
* Enable larger panorama thumbnails (Issue #2780)
* Disable ``archive_rss`` link handler, which was useless because no
  such RSS was ever generated (Issue #2783)
* Ignore files ending wih "bak" (Issue #2740)
* Use page.tmpl by default, which is inherited from story.tmpl (Issue
  #1891)

Other
-----

* Limit Jupyter support to notebook >= 4.0.0 (it already was in
  requirements-extras.txt; Issue #2733)
