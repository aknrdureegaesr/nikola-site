On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.1.3. This release has some minor fixes, and
a minor dependency change.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Provide the full ``GLOBAL_CONTEXT`` to the post list shortcode plugin
  (Issue #3481)
* Add ``BasePlugin.register_auto_watched_folder()``
* Allow different ``PANDOC_OPTIONS`` values based on input extensions
  by specifying a dict of ``{".extension": [options]}`` (Issue #3492)
* Allow boolean/integer ``pretty_url`` post meta values in YAML/TOML
  (Issue #3503)

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix an ``UnboundLocalError`` crash in ``nikola deploy`` (Issue
  #3479)

Other
-----

* For ``nikola github_deploy``, the ``ghp-import`` PyPI package is now
  recommended instead of ``ghp-import2``. Both versions should work,
  but you can’t have both installed at the same time. (Issue #3499)
