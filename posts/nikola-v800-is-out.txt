On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.0.0. After 15 months in development, we’ve
created our best release ever, with new features, many bugs squashed,
and some improvements under the hood.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola==8.0.0``.

Changes
=======

Important compatibility changes
-------------------------------

* Rename ``crumbs.tmpl`` to ``ui_helper.tmpl`` and the breadcrumbs
  ``bar`` function to ``breadcrumbs`` (your templates may need
  changing as well)
* Rename ``post.is_mathjax`` to ``post.has_math``. Themes using
  ``post.is_mathjax`` must be updated; it is recommended that they are
  changed to use ``math_helper.tmpl``.
* Reading reST docinfo metadata, including first heading as title,
  requires ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA`` now (Issue #2987)
* RSS feeds might have changed their places due to ``RSS_PATH``
  behavior changes (you may need to change ``RSS_PATH``,
  ``RSS_FILENAME_BASE``)
* Atom feeds for archives and Atom pagination are no longer supported
  (Issue #3016)
* Sections are replaced by categories (Issue #2833)
* You need ``<a class="reference">`` (instead of ``image-reference``)
  to activate the lightbox now
* Date formatting now uses the Babel library, you might need to
  change ``BABEL_FORMAT`` (Issues #2606, 3121)
* The first heading in a reST document is not removed anymore by
  default unless ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA`` is enabled
  (Issues #2382, #3124)

* All built-in themes now support ``updated`` timestamp fields in
  posts. The update time, if it is specified and different from
  the posting time, will be displayed as

  time is specified, the posting time will be displayed alone.
