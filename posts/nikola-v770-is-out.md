On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate availability of Nikola v7.7.0. It fixes some bugs and adds new features.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
