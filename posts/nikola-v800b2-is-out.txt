On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.0.0b2. This release fixes some bugs found in
v8.0.0b1, and adds a few new appearance features (featured posts,
alternate navigation links)

The final version of Nikola v8 should be out in early June.
We welcome everyone to test it with their site and report any issues
to make it the best release ever.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
