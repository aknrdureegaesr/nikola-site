On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.1.2. This release has a bunch of new features,
fixes some bugs, and improves compatibility with some dependencies and Windows.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Support for multiple authors per post — comma-separated, enabled by
  ``MULTIPLE_AUTHORS_PER_POST`` setting (Issue #3252)
* Add ``navbar_custom_bg`` theme option to ``bootstrap4`` and document
  options for ``bootstrap4`` better (Issue #3443)
* Add Marathi translation
* Restore ``caps`` typogrify filter (wraps strings of capital letters
  with ``<span class="caps">`` (via Issue #3405)

  ``-n`` argument to pass to ``nikola build`` (Issue #3401)

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix previewimages (post- and root-relative) in bootblog4/galleries
  featured posts for non-server-root sites (Issue #3471)
* Windows: Also fix symlinks when installing from source with pip; if possible,
  enable Developer Mode and run ``git config --global core.symlinks true``

  link (``<a>``) to have an ``<img>`` as a child in order to make the
  link activate the lightbox. (Issue #3472)

  and bytestrings (Issue #3466)

* Don’t break slugs with slashes in ``doc`` directive (Issue #3450)
* Avoid warnings from type annotations in ``auto`` caused by missing
  ``aiohttp`` (Issue #3451)
* Ensure query strings and fragments are kept with ``URL_TYPE =
  "full_path"`` (Issue #3448)
* Don’t run typogrify filters on ``<title>`` tag to avoid adding extra
  tags (Issue #3405)
* Fix handling of duplicate plugins on Windows
* Allow else clause in post-list plugin. (Issue #3436)
* Ensure ``type`` metadata value from plugins is preserved (Issue 3445)
