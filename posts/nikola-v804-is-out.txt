On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.0.4. This release fixes a few small bugs,
including a date glitch that appeared around New Year’s Eve.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes
=======

Nikola now supports Python 3.5 or newer. If you are on 3.4, please
upgrade to a newer release of Python.

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix hiding future posts in sitemaps for posts without pretty URLs
  (Issue #3339)
* Pass the correct parameters to shortcodes in jupyter notebooks
* Fix handling of conflicts between posts/pages and indexes generated
  by ``CATEGORY_PAGES_FOLLOW_DESTPATH``
* Fix default date format to ``yyyy-MM-dd`` to avoid bug with ISO
  years (Issue #3337)
* Remove ``extra_header`` and ``extra_footer`` from ``base`` theme
  due to incompatibility with Mako. The blocks are still available
  in ``bootstrap4`` and ``bootblog4``. (Issue #3319 via #3291)
* Show tracebacks when ``conf.py`` cannot be imported
* Fix loading complex config files that import modules (Issue #3314)
* Fix behavior of header demotion for negative values
* If ``FILE_METADATA_REGEXP`` is set, load metadata from the filename
  first, then continue with the other sources (Issue #3344)
