On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.8.15 and v8.0.0b1.

Nikola v7.8.15 is the last v7 maintenance release with a few more bug fixes.

Nikola v8.0.0b1 (Beta 1) is the first test release of the v8 series. The v8 series adds a ton of
new features and fixes bugs, while also breaking backwards compatibility.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image
galleries, and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds
are extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what
has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola==7.8.15`` or ``pip install Nikola==8.0.0.beta1``.

Before upgrading to Nikola v8, `make sure to read the “Upgrading” document`__.

Changes in v7.8.15
==================

* Fix behavior for posts not available in default language
  (Issues #2956 and #3073)
* Fix behavior of RSS_PATH to do what the documentation
  says it does (Issue #3024)
* Use documented dateutil API for time zone list (Issue #3006)

Changes in v8.0.0b1
===================

Important compatibility changes
-------------------------------

* Rename ``crumbs.tmpl`` to ``ui_helper.tmpl`` and the breadcrumbs
  ``bar`` function to ``breadcrumbs`` (your templates may need
  changing as well)

  ``post.is_mathjax`` must be updated; it is recommended that they are
  changed to use ``math_helper.tmpl``.
* Reading reST docinfo metadata, including first heading as title,
  requires ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA`` now (Issue #2987)
* RSS feeds might have changed their places due to ``RSS_PATH``
  behavior changes (you may need to change ``RSS_PATH``,
  ``RSS_FILENAME_BASE``)

  (Issue #3016)

  (supports ``published``, ``featured``, ``draft``, ``private``)
