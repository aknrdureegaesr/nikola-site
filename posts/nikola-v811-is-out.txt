On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.1.1. This release is mainly due to an
incorrect PGP key being used for the PyPI artifacts; three regressions
were also fixed in this release.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
