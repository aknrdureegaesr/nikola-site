On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.2.3. This is a bugfix release, which fixes
compatibility with python-markdown and two more minor bugs.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads
=========

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes
=======

* Compatibility with Markdown 3.4.0 (Issue #3635)
* Find substring in string instead of using ``contains`` in utils
* Don't add semicolon in docinfo fields via CSS (caused duplicated
  semicolons)

Nikola now requires Python 3.7 or newer.
