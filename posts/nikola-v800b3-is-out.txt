On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.0.0b3. This is the third and hopefully final
beta of Nikola v8. The big change in this release is the adoption of
Babel to handle date translations (instead of relying on system locale,
which didn’t work well for us). Other issues and bugs were fixed.

Many themes in our Index have been ported for Nikola v8, but some of
them are not yet there.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
