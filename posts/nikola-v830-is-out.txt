On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.3.0. This release adds support for Python 3.12,
with some other features and bugfixes.

Note that Nikola v8.3.0 no longer uses the Yapsy plugin manager,
which has been replaced by a custom, minimal manager.
The new Nikola Plugin Manager was tested with some typical plugins,
but there might be issues if your plugins have an unusual structure
or are outdated. Please update your plugins and report any bugs
you may encounter.

The Nikola developers would also like to express discontent with Python’s
efforts to remove features from the standard library, causing breakage
without a solid reason, other than “it’s old”.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Downloads

Install using ``pip install Nikola``.

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Implement a new plugin manager from scratch to replace Yapsy,
  which does not work on Python 3.12 due to Python 3.12 carelessly
  removing parts of the standard library (Issue #3719)
* Support for Discourse as comment system (Issue #3689)

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix loading of templates from plugins with ``__init__.py`` files
  (Issue #3725)
* Fix margins of paragraphs at the end of sections (Issue #3704)
* Ignore ``.DS_Store`` files in listing indexes (Issue #3698)
* Fix baguetteBox.js invoking in the base theme (Issue #3687)
* Fix development (preview) server ``nikola auto``
  for non-root SITE_URL, in particular when URL_TYPE is full_path.
  (Issue #3715)

For plugin developers
---------------------

Nikola now requires the ``.plugin`` file to contain a ``[Nikola]``
section with a ``PluginCategory`` entry set to the name of the plugin
category class. This was already required by ``plugins.getnikola.com``,
but you may have custom plugins that don’t have this set.
