On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.0.0rc1. This is the end of the road to Nikola
version 8. Within 48 hours, assuming there are no grave bugs reported in that
timeframe, we intend to release v8 final.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Changes
=======

Features
--------

* Add Vietnamese translation by Hoai-Thu Vuong
* Don’t generate gallery index if the destination directory is
  site root and it would conflict with blog index (Issue #3133)
* All built-in themes now support ``updated`` timestamp fields in
  posts. The update time, if it is specified and different from
  the posting time, will be displayed as
  "{postDate} (${messages("updated")} {updateDate})". If no update
  time is specified, the posting time will be displayed alone.
* All built-in themes now support the ``DATE_FANCINESS`` option.
* Theme bundles are now parsed using the configparser module and
  can support newlines inside entries as well as comments
* Make bootstrap4 navbar color configurable with
  ``THEME_CONFIG['navbar_light']`` (Issue #2863)

Bugfixes
--------

* Use UTF-8 instead of system encoding for gallery metadata.yml file
* Do not remove first heading in document (reST document title)
  if ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA`` is disabled (Issue #3124)
* Remove ``NO_DOCUTILS_TITLE_TRANSFORM`` setting,
  this is now default behavior if ``USE_REST_DOCINFO_METADATA``
  is disabled (Issue #2382, #3124)
* Enforce trailing slash for directories in ``nikola auto``
  (Issue #3140)
* Galleries with baguetteBox don’t glitch out on the first image
  anymore (Issue #3141)

Removed features
----------------

* Moved ``tag_cloud_data.json`` generation to a separate
  ``tagcloud`` plugin (Issue #1696)
* The ``webassets`` library is no longer required, we now manually
  bundle files (Issue #3074)
