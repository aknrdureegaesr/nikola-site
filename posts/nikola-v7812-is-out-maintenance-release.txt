On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v7.8.12. This is a maintenance release for the
v7 series.

Future releases in the v7 series are going to be small maintenance
releases that include bugfixes only, as work on v8.0.0 is underway.

What is Nikola?
===============

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown â€” and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).
